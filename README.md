# Cisco Network Project: VLANs + DHCP + Inter-VLAN Routing + OSPF

## Layihənin Təsviri
This project is a fully functional network lab created in Cisco Packet Tracer. The main objectives of the project are:
  -Segmentation of the network using VLANs
  -Automatic IP assignment to hosts via DHCP
  -Inter-VLAN routing to enable communication between VLANs
  -Dynamic routing using the OSPF protocol

The lab is designed to simulate a realistic network environment and is ideal for network administrators, students, and lab users.
